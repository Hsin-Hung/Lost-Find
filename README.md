# Lost-Find
  People lose their stuff everywhere and this app allows you to find your lose items in ease. After creating an account, you can either post what you have lost or see if someone had just lose something in your area. It takes in your location when you use the app and show you only the posted lost items in your area. If you lose something, you can post the photo of the item, descriptions, location, the amount of reward, radius from the location, and etc. It then notify people in that area. The person who finds your item can message the owner of the post and have a p2p chat with the owner. The app is design for campus/coomunity use since there is a possible flaw that people will use this app to steal other's lost items and it will less likely to happen if you know they are people who go to same college with you. This app relies a lot on user's ethics.
